    <h2>The Biodiversity Footprint methodology and GLOBIO</h2>
    <p>
      The methodology used in this calculator is based on the <a href="http://www.plansup.nl/expertise/biodiversity-footprint/">Biodiversity Footprint methodology</a> developed by Plansup in collaboration with Wageningen Environmental Research (Alterra). The calculator is a limited version of the full Biodiversity Footprint method and focuses on the impact of the two most important pressure types on biodiversity: Land use and Green House Gas emissions. The impact is calculated for three parts of the value chain: Raw materials (/suppliers), Production process, and Transport. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Biodiversity Footprint (BF) methodology is using parts of the internationally implemented <a href="http://www.globio.info/">GLOBIO methodology</a> developed by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. In GLOBIO so-called 'cause-effect' relationships are used (i.e. the effect of a pressure factor on biodiversity), based on the best available scientific knowledge. The local impact of pressure factors is determined in terms of the presence of species and the number of individuals per species. The BF method has been developed for the impact of three pressure types: Land use, Climate Change (via Green House Gas emissions), and Emissions of Nitrogen and Phosphorous into water. For the Dutch situation, the impact of Water extraction is added. By comparing the impact in the current situation with the impact in a new situation (after measures) the effectiveness of biodiversity friendly measures can be tested, not only afterwards but also in advance. On the basis of this method companies can assess their current impact on biodiversity and estimate their future impact after implementation of planned measures.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The biodiversity footprint is expressed in MSA.ha. MSA stands for Mean Species Abundance of original species, representing the intactness of the nature relative to the original state. The MSA value ranges between 0 and 1; 1 implicates that the area is undisturbed, and 0 for a complete loss of the original biodiversity. The MSA.ha footprint indicates the change of intactness within the area that is impacted for the product, multiplied with the extend of that area. The general equation for determining the biodiversity footprint is: <br>
    </p>
    <h5>Footprint = ∑(ha area in use_i * [1-MSA_pressure factor_i])</h5>
    <p>in which i= land use, GHG</p>
    <p>Please note that the method does not distinguish between current or previous conversion of land. Although the company cannot be held responsible for the destruction of nature that was caused many years ago by former users of the land, it is responsible for its current use of the land which prevents original biodiversity to restore.<br></p>
    <p>The BF method is location specific while other methods such as Life Cycle Assessments use a regional approach and are less specific on the type of land use. As the biodiversity impact is highly dependent on the use intensity, a differentiation of land use types is essential for a correct biodiversity assessment.<br></p>
    <p>The method for the calculation is explained in more detail underneath, and per pressure type.
      Additional information on the BF method can be found <a href="http://www.plansup.nl/models/biodiversity-footprint-model/">here</a>.<br></p>

<h2>Land use impact</h2>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dods/image/upload/c_fill,g_center,h_500,w_1120/v1/agriculture%20and%20rural%20affairs/4875013153_062bcfb00b_b_dh8imd.jpg" class="rounded float-right">

<p>
  In classic economics land is one of the major factors needed for production. Land is the backbone of agriculture, but also needed for other economic developments such as urban expansion, infrastructural development and industrial growth. Companies put a claim on land as they need raw materials and areas for the realization of their production facilities. The use of land results in a loss of biodiversity as habitats of many species, that originally lived or foraged there, cannot be used by them anymore. As a result species need to migrate to other suitable areas, if available. <br>
</p>
<p> <span>Land use is worldwide the most important factor for biodiversity loss. The more land is used for human development, the less land will be available for nature. In addition, the higher the land use intensity is in an area, the higher the disturbance to its original nature, resulting in a lower remaining biodiversity. An overview of MSA values per land use type is provided <a href="#section-5">here</a>.
These values are based on existing cause-effect relations from GLOBIO. If a land use type does not correspond exactly with that of yours, you should select the type of which the management and intensity is closest to those of your land use. In some cases the MSA value of a land use type can deviate from the standard GLOBIO land use value table, but adjustments of these values should only be based on expert knowledge.</span>
</p>
<p>Land use plays a significant role throughout the production chain of a company. Land is used for the production of raw materials, building of production facilities, parking areas and roads, storage facilities and for waste disposal.<br></p>
<p>So there is a challenge for companies that want to reduce their impact on biodiversity caused by land use. To realize this, a company can implement two major strategies:<br>
  - By a reduction of the <b>use-intensity</b> of the land needed for the products<br>
  - By a reduction of the <b>extend</b> of the area that is in use for the products, e.g. by an increase in productivity</p>
<p>Please note that there can be a trade-off between the two. A reduction of the use-intensity of the land used for your bio-materials, e.g. by changing from regular to organic farming, leads in many cases to a reduction of the productivity. To achieve the same production level, more land is needed which will have an adverse impact on biodiversity. Although the organic land has a higher biodiversity level, the area required will be bigger too and result in an increase of the land related biodiversity footprint.<br></p>
    <span><b>Economic allocation correction</b></span>
<p>Land can have multiple uses and if a use is not related to the product for which you calculate the footprint, it should be excluded from the calculation. For this reason it is possible to correct multiple land use in your calculation by implementing the principle of <b>economic allocation</b>. In such a case the footprint of the use of the land should be corrected by the share of the economic value of the land use for the product, compared to the total revenue of the land for all products. For example in case wool is purchased for the production of sweaters, only the land related footprint for the production of wool should be taken into account and not the land footprint for the production of (sheep) meat. In case the share between the wool price and the meat price is 1:9, the land related footprint of the pasture needs to be multiplied by 0.1. Another example for an economic allocation correction is in case a factory produces also other products in the same period. This footprint for the production facility area should be corrected by the economic share of relevant product. Other factors for which the economic allocation correction can be applied are for instance tourism and nature conservation. Multiple use of land can lead to a reduction of the land related footprint. Similarly the footprint of GHG should also be corrected in case emissions are also produced for other products that are made in the same facility for the same period. In case 10 ton of CO2 is produced for the fabrication of the product and 30 ton for the production of other goods, the economic allocation factor should be 0.25.<br><br>
  The MSA indicator is a proxy for biodiversity, expressing the extent to which the natural state of ecosystems is still intact (see above). For the footprint calculation the MSA change in the impacted area is multiplied with the extent of the impacted area. In case of multiple land use an Economic allocation correction factor is applied.<br></p>
<p>For the calculation of the total land use related biodiversity footprint the individual footprints are calculated per part of the chain and added to each other:<br></p>
<h5>Footprint land use change: (Σ ha land_use_i * [1-MSA_ land_use_i] * Econ_alloc factor_i).</h5>
<p>Variables in this formula per selected part of the chain:<br>
  - i = Land use item (e.g. land used for production of different raw materials, buildings, etc)<br>
  - Land use area item (Hectare, per selected land use type, direct input by user)<br>
  - Land use quality item (MSA, per selected land use type, via table)<br>
  - Economic allocation item (only in case of multiple use of the land. Fraction of economic
  value of item / total economic value of all items produced on the land)<br>
  </p>
<p>The total biodiversity footprint for land use is calculated with the following formula:<br></p>
<h5>Biodiversity footprint land use = MSA.ha_lu_supplier + MSA.ha_lu_production</h5>
<p>This calculation can be used both for the baseline situation and the future scenario.
  Example: Land impact by Supplier (e.g. for the production of the raw materials, produced locally or abroad) + Impact of the production process (of company or product) itself.<br></p>
<p>In case land is used for the facilitation of the transport of the product, the corresponding land use related biodiversity footprint of this part of the value chain needs to be added to the other two footprints.<br></p>

  <h2>Greenhouse gas impact</h2>
<!--<img src="https://saferenvironment.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/pds_greenhouse_effect.jpg" alt="greenhouse"> -->
<img src="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/images/greenhouse3.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="greenhouse">

<p>
  The main effect of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is global
  warming which results in climate change. GHG such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated
  gases all help trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes
  life as we know it possible. However, human activities, especially
  burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have intensified the
  greenhouse effect, causing global warming.

  Increases in the different greenhouse gases have many other effects apart
  from global warming including a change in rainfall distribution, ocean acidification, smog pollution,
  ozone depletion as well as changes to plant growth and biodiversity.<br><br>

  The climate-related dose response relationship from GLOBIO3 shows the decrease in biodiversity (MSA) versus the increase in global mean temperature (see <a href="http://edepot.wur.nl/328775">Arets et al, 2014</a>). The contribution to the average global temperature rise (in ° C year) per kg CO2 is calculated on the basis of temperature factors (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652612003101">Hanafiah et al. 2012</a>) which show the increase in global mean temperature per kg of CO2 emissions. For a 100 year time horizon, this is 4.2 • 10-14 ° C y / kg CO2. Because climate change has not only a local but also worldwide impact on biodiversity, the climate impact on MSA occurs worldwide in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Thus, the MSA impact per ha is multiplied by the total global land area for ecosystems in natural and semi-natural state. This delivers emissions per kg in CO2 equivalent, an MSA impact of  3.29 * 10 - 5 MSA.ha (see also, <a href="http://www.plansup.nl/cms/wp-content/uploads/biodiversiteitsvoetafdruk-eindrapport-01032016.pdf">van Rooij et al., 2016</a>)<br><br>
  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important GHG, but there are other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, with the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrogen oxide (N2O) being the most common. In a first step, the emissions of different types of GHG must be converted into a standard unit. In the case of GHG, the standard unit is expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq.). Methane is a GHG 25 times as strong as CO2 and nitrogen oxide is even 298 times stronger. The emission of 1 kg CH4 thus corresponds to the emission of 25 kg CO2 (25 CO2 eq.), While the emission of 1 kg N2O thus corresponds to the emission of 298 kg CO2.<br><br>
  In order to calculate the climate related impact of a company or of its product,  the contribution of GHG emissions has to be determined. This requires insight into the GHG emissions of a company and its products for which the biodiversity footprint is to be determined. It concerns, for example, emissions from transport, energy and heating, and process emissions as well as emissions from agriculture (e.g. Methane) and land use.<br><br>
  Larger companies often already quantify the emissions of these greenhouse gases, for example for Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), and report emissions in annual reports. These emissions are often aggregated. However, the identification of action perspectives to reduce the impact on biodiversity due to climate change requires insight into the emissions of specific processes and chain components. Therefore, in the BF methodology (and in this calculator), the emissions are split up where possible for those parts of the chain that are relevant for companies to limit their biodiversity footprint.<br><br>
  In case you have no information about GHG emissions, you can use existing calculation tools to convert, for example, fuel and energy use into GHG emissions. Such calculation tools are also used in typical LCA calculations. The calculator has already included CO2 equivalent values for a few GHG and energy sources. These values have been extracted from the Gross Energy Requirement (GER) table that you can download in the link underneath. The table contains several CO2 eq values per unit fossil fuel, renewable energy source, production of plastic, chemicals, metals, building materials or any other commonly used items in the production or transportation process. This GER table originates from the Ecoinvent 3 database is frequently updated and published by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO).<br><br>

  With the transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and final products, CO2 is emitted. This emission needs to be added to the GHG emission of the other two parts of the chain. CO2 equivalents are known per transport unit (ton/km) for different transportation types. The most common transportation types including CO2 eq are already included in the calculator. More transportation types and CO2 eq values can be found in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2018/11/GER-waarden%2520en%2520CO2-lijst%2520augustus%25202018.xlsx&ved=2ahUKEwim8_vgr8SFAxUP_rsIHeOyCCwQFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1GB5WW8FmIn-_pfzDXr8L-">GER table</a>. In this table go to the 'Transport' sheet/tab where you can find the climate impact values for each transport type in kg CO2 eq. <br><br></p>

    <h2>Support and full analysis</h2>
    <p>
      In case you would like to get assistance with the inventory of input data, or would like to get a more comprehensive analysis based on the full BF method, you can contact Wilbert van Rooij of Plansup (<a href="mailto:plansup.consult@gmail.com">plansup.consult&#64;gmail.com</a>). Support can also be provided for an analysis of potential biodiversity friendly measures.<br><br>
      This BF calculator is limited to the impact of two pressure factors for three components within the value chain of a product. The calculator does not include all options of the full BF method.As a result the calculator is a first step to assess the footprint of a company or product.<br><br>
      A full BF analysis includes an inventory of all required input data. The analysis will be based on this information. Next to the impact assessment of land use and GHG, an analysis will be made of the impact by N and P emissions to water and, in case applicable, the impact of water extraction to water sensitive neighboring nature areas. The full analysis also includes more parts of the value chain (e.g. storage,  waste processing).<br><br>
